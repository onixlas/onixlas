## About me

I am an **AI / LLM Engineer and Data Scientist** with 3+ years of industry experience building and deploying production-grade machine learning systems, primarily in **NLP and LLM-based applications**.

I work at the intersection of **classical ML, modern LLM pipelines, and applied MLOps**, focusing on solving real business problems with measurable impact. I have hands-on experience delivering **end-to-end ML solutions** — from problem formulation and experimentation to online inference in production.
